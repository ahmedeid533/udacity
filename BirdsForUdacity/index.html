       <p>Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves. </p> 
        <p>
            characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws .the laying of hard-shelled eggs,
            a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart.and a strong yet lightweight skeleton.
        </p> 
        <p>
            Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5.5 cm bee hummingbird to the 2.8 m ostrich. <br>
            There are about ten thousand living species, more than half of which are passerine 
            or "perching" birds.
        </p>  
        <p>
            Birds have wings whose development varies according to species .
            the only known groups without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. 
        </p>  
        <p>
            Wings, which evolved from forelimbs, gave birds the ability to fly .
            although further evolution has led to the loss of flight in some birds. including ratites,
            penguins, and diverse endemic island species.
        </p>
        <p>
            The digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight. 
            Some bird species of aquatic environments,
            particularly seabirds and some waterbirds. have further evolved for swimming.

        <p>
            Seabirds (also known as marine birds) are birds that are adapted to life within the marine environment.
            While seabirds vary greatly in lifestyle, behaviour and physiology, they often exhibit striking convergent evolution, 
        </p>
        <p>
            as the same environmental problems and feeding niches have resulted in similar adaptations.
            The first seabirds evolved in the Cretaceous period, and modern seabird families emerged in the Paleogene.     
        </p>    
           
        <p>
            In general, seabirds live longer, breed later and have fewer young than other birds do,
            but they invest a great deal of time in their young. Most species nest in colonies, 
            which can vary in size from a few dozen birds to millions. Many species are famous for undertaking long annual migrations,
        </p>
        <p>
            crossing the equator or circumnavigating the Earth in some cases. They feed both at the ocean's surface and below it, 
            and even feed on each other. Seabirds can be highly pelagic, coastal, 
            or in some cases spend a part of the year away from the sea entirely.
        </p>
        <p>
            Seabirds and humans have a long history together: they have provided food to hunters, 
            guided fishermen to fishing stocks and led sailors to land. Many species are currently threatened by human activities, 
        </p>
        <p> 
            such as from oil spills, getting trapped in nets, and by climate change and severe weather. 
            Conservation efforts include the establishment of wildlife refugees and adjustments to fishing techniques.

            Desert Birds: A desert is a barren landscape area with a little to no water (no precipitation) 
            is found which makes the living condition extremely hostile for plants and animals.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this extreme condition, there are different desert birds which thrive with many developed adaptations.
            In this page, let’s explore a desert bird and it's unique adaptations.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Cactus Wren is considered to be the largest type of wren in the US. 
            In terms of size, it is closely similar to that of the Spotted Towhee.
        </p>
        <p>
            The wren is characterized by having short rounded wings but the long rounded tail and long heavy bill. 
            In terms of color, it is color brown with white “eyebrows“.
        </p>
        <p>
            Diet: The bird normally feeds on insects such as beetles, wasps, grasshoppers, and ants. 
            Sometimes, it also eats fruits and small frogs and small reptiles.
        </p>
        <p>
            Geographical Distribution: In general, these desert birds are distributed throughout the South Western deserts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Adaptations: Unlike most wrens, Cactus wrens can be normally found perched on top of shrubs and cacti (hence their name). 
            Basically, they do this to announce their presence.

        <p>
            ofcourse the most famous kind of them is the Penguins
        </p>
        <p>
            Penguins are a group of aquatic flightless birds. They live almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere: only one species,
            the Galápagos penguin, is found north of the Equator.
        </p>
        <p>
            Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage and flippers for swimming.
            Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sea life 
            which they catch with their bills and swallow it whole while swimming
            A penguin has a spiny tongue and powerful jaws to grip slippery prey 
        </p>
        <p>
            and they could also be categoric sea birds,
            They spend roughly half of their lives on land and the other half in the sea.     
        </p>
        <p>
            The largest living species is the Emperor penguin
            on average, adults are about 1.1 m tall and weigh 35 kg.
        </p>
        <p>
            The smallest penguin species is the little blue penguin, 
            also known as the fairy penguin, which stands around 33 cm tall and weighs 1 kg.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, larger penguins generally inhabit colder regions, 
            and smaller penguins inhabit regions with temperate or tropical climates. 
            Some prehistoric penguin species were enormous: as tall or heavy as an adult human Hmm intristing! not?
        </p>
        <p>
            There was a great diversity of species in subantarctic regions,
            and at least one giant species in a region around 2,000 km south of the equator 35 mya,
            in a climate decidedly warmer than today.

            most of beautiful birds live in forrest like peacock , parrot and rainbow lorikeet .
        </p>
        <p>
            The rainbow lorikeet is a species of parrot found in Australia. It is common along the eastern seaboard,
            from northern Queensland to South Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
            Its habitat is rainforest, coastal bush and woodland areas. 
            Six taxa traditionally listed as subspecies of the rainbow lorikeet are now treated as separate species.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rainbow lorikeets have been introduced to Perth, Western Australia,Tasmania, Auckland, New Zealand and Hong Kong.
        </p>
        <p>
            The rainbow lorikeet is a medium-sized parrot, with the length ranging from 25 to 30 cm including the tail, 
            and the weight varies from 75 to 157 g.
        </p>
        <p>
            The plumage of the nominate race, as with all subspecies, is very bright and colorful.
            The head is deep blue with a greenish-yellow nuchal collar, 
            and the rest of the upper parts (wings, back and tail) are green.
        </p>
        <p>
            The chest is orange/yellow. The belly is deep blue, and the thighs and rump are green. 
            In flight a yellow wing-bar contrasts clearly with the red underwing coverts.
            There is little to visually distinguish between the sexes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Juveniles have a black beak, which gradually brightens to orange in the adults.
        </p>
        <p>
            The markings of Trichoglossus moluccanus resemble those of the coconut lorikeet ,
            but with a blue belly and a more orange breast with little or no blue-black barring.
